# Enhanced Tic-tac-toe

[React docs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) teaches how to build a simple tic-tac-toe app and suggests as exercise some enhancments on this app.
This is a version that includes those enhancements. They are:

* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
